# All existing and projected limits divided into their relevant coupling. Existing limits are found in the main folder, projected limits are found in the 'Projections' subfolders.

## Currently include limits on:
### Axions
* Axion Photon coupling
* Axion Electron coupling
* Axion Neutron coupling
* Axion Proton coupling
* Axion EDM  coupling
* CP-violating couplings (Scalar Nucleon Yukawa coupling and Monopole-Dipole pseudoscalar couplings to electrons and nucleons)
* Peccei-Quinn scale fa

# Scalars
* Scalar-EM coupling (in dilaton form)
* Scalar-electron coupling (in dilaton form)

# Dark photons/Vectors
* Dark Photon kinetic mixing with SM photon
* Vector boson coupling to B-L
